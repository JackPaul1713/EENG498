2. REPORT DETAILS
-----------------
TIMING-4#1 Critical Warning
Invalid primary clock redefinition on a clock tree  
Invalid clock redefinition on a clock tree. The primary clock vc/inst/clk_in1 is defined downstream of clock sysClk and overrides its insertion delay and/or waveform definition
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-6#1 Critical Warning
No common primary clock between related clocks  
The clocks sysClk and clk_out1_clk_wiz_0 are related (timed together) but they have no common primary clock. The design could fail in hardware. To find a timing path between these clocks, run the following command: report_timing -from [get_clocks sysClk] -to [get_clocks clk_out1_clk_wiz_0]
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-7#1 Critical Warning
No common node between related clocks  
The clocks sysClk and clk_out1_clk_wiz_0 are related (timed together) but they have no common node. The design could fail in hardware. To find a timing path between these clocks, run the following command: report_timing -from [get_clocks sysClk] -to [get_clocks clk_out1_clk_wiz_0]
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-27#1 Critical Warning
Invalid primary clock on hierarchical pin  
A primary clock vc/inst/clk_in1 is created on an inappropriate internal pin vc/inst/clk_in1. It is not recommended to create a primary clock on a hierarchical pin when its driver pin has a fanout connected to multiple clock pins
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-51#1 Critical Warning
No common phase between related clocks from parallel CMBs  
The clocks sysClk and clk_out1_clk_wiz_0 are timed together but have no phase relationship. The design could fail in hardware. The clocks originate from two parallel Clock Modifying Blocks and at least one of the MMCM or PLLs clock dividers is not set to 1. To be safely timed, all MMCMs or PLLs involved in parallel clocking must have the clock divider set to 1.
Related violations: <none>

CKLD-2#1 Warning
Clock Net has IO Driver, not a Clock Buf, and/or non-Clock loads  
Clock net sysClk_IBUF is directly driven by an IO rather than a Clock Buffer or may be an IO driving a mix of Clock Buffer and non-Clock loads. This connectivity should be reviewed and corrected as appropriate. Driver(s): prevBtn_reg[0]/C, prevBtn_reg[1]/C, prevBtn_reg[2]/C,
triggerTime_reg[10]/C, triggerTime_reg[4]/C, triggerTime_reg[5]/C,
triggerTime_reg[5]_replica/C, triggerTime_reg[6]/C, triggerTime_reg[7]/C,
triggerTime_reg[8]/C, triggerTime_reg[9]/C, triggerVolt_reg[10]/C,
triggerVolt_reg[4]/C, triggerVolt_reg[7]/C, triggerVolt_reg[8]/C
 (the first 15 of 48 listed)
Related violations: <none>

LUTAR-1#1 Warning
LUT drives async reset alert  
LUT cell hdmi_inst/inst/encr/oserdes_m_i_1, with 2 or more inputs, drives asynchronous preset/clear pin(s) hdmi_inst/inst/encg/dout_reg[9]/CLR, hdmi_inst/inst/encr/cnt_reg[1]/CLR,
hdmi_inst/inst/encr/cnt_reg[2]/CLR, hdmi_inst/inst/encr/cnt_reg[3]/CLR,
hdmi_inst/inst/encr/cnt_reg[4]/CLR, hdmi_inst/inst/encr/dout_reg[0]/CLR,
hdmi_inst/inst/encr/dout_reg[1]/CLR, hdmi_inst/inst/encr/dout_reg[2]/CLR,
hdmi_inst/inst/encr/dout_reg[3]/CLR, hdmi_inst/inst/encr/dout_reg[4]/CLR,
hdmi_inst/inst/encr/dout_reg[5]/CLR, hdmi_inst/inst/encr/dout_reg[6]/CLR,
hdmi_inst/inst/encr/dout_reg[7]/CLR, hdmi_inst/inst/encr/dout_reg[8]/CLR,
hdmi_inst/inst/encr/dout_reg[9]/CLR (the first 15 of 42 listed). The LUT may glitch and trigger an unexpected reset, even if it is a properly timed path.
Related violations: <none>
